## 2026-05-08 - RequestAnimationFrame Debouncing
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` cause significant layout thrashing when triggering synchronous DOM reads (`getBoundingClientRect`) and writes (`style.setProperty`).
**Action:** Always wrap high-frequency DOM manipulation tasks in a `requestAnimationFrame` and cancel any pending frames, effectively synchronizing execution with the display refresh rate to avoid main thread blocking.

## 2026-05-12 - Consolidate IntersectionObservers
**Learning:** Instantiating multiple `IntersectionObserver` instances with the identical configuration to observe separate elements creates unnecessary memory overhead and redundant callback executions during scroll events.
**Action:** When observing multiple elements with identical logic and boundaries, batch them into a single `IntersectionObserver` instance to improve overall performance.

## 2026-05-13 - Global Observer Caching
**Learning:** Instantiating multiple IntersectionObserver instances for common interactions (like scroll reveals on multiple components) creates unnecessary memory overhead.
**Action:** Use a module-level `Map` to cache IntersectionObserver instances by their configuration (like `threshold`), and a `WeakMap` to store per-element callbacks. This heavily reduces object creation and memory overhead by allowing multiple elements to share a single observer under the hood.

## 2024-07-05 - Concurrent External API Requests in Cloudflare Workers
**Learning:** In the Cloudflare Workers environment (`workers/`), external network requests (like sending multiple emails via an API) should never be executed sequentially unless there is a strict dependency. Sequential requests unnecessarily block the worker's thread and directly increase the total user response time by the sum of the latencies.
**Action:** Always use `Promise.all()` to execute independent external network requests concurrently in Cloudflare Workers to minimize execution time and reduce overall latency.
