## 2026-05-08 - RequestAnimationFrame Debouncing
**Learning:** High-frequency events like `mousemove` cause significant layout thrashing when triggering synchronous DOM reads (`getBoundingClientRect`) and writes (`style.setProperty`).
**Action:** Always wrap high-frequency DOM manipulation tasks in a `requestAnimationFrame` and cancel any pending frames, effectively synchronizing execution with the display refresh rate to avoid main thread blocking.

## 2026-05-12 - Consolidate IntersectionObservers
**Learning:** Instantiating multiple `IntersectionObserver` instances with the identical configuration to observe separate elements creates unnecessary memory overhead and redundant callback executions during scroll events.
**Action:** When observing multiple elements with identical logic and boundaries, batch them into a single `IntersectionObserver` instance to improve overall performance.

## 2026-05-13 - Global Observer Caching
**Learning:** Instantiating multiple IntersectionObserver instances for common interactions (like scroll reveals on multiple components) creates unnecessary memory overhead.
**Action:** Use a module-level `Map` to cache IntersectionObserver instances by their configuration (like `threshold`), and a `WeakMap` to store per-element callbacks. This heavily reduces object creation and memory overhead by allowing multiple elements to share a single observer under the hood.
## 2026-05-14 - Internal Navigation Performance
**Learning:** Using standard HTML `<a>` tags for internal links in a Next.js application causes full page reloads, bypassing the framework's client-side routing and prefetching capabilities. This breaks the Single Page Application (SPA) experience and drastically increases navigation latency.
**Action:** Always use the Next.js `<Link>` component from `next/link` for internal navigation routes to ensure instant client-side transitions and leverage automatic route prefetching.
